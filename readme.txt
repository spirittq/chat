1. Run server.py. Currently server runs on localhost:8080.
2. Two instances of client.py should be run (each for one chat window).
3. Running client.py should trigger chat window appearance. Follow instructions there.
4. You can send message by clicking "Send" button or clicking "Enter".
5. Clicking on "Print" will generate chat transcript.
6. You can quit by typing {{{quit}}} or closing chat window on "X".
7. When running server, "server.log" will be generated.

P.S. "requirements.txt" is empty as no custom packages were used :)
